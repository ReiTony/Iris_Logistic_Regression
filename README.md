# Iris_Logistic_Regression
This project explores binary logistic regression on the Iris dataset to classify Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. Evaluate model accuracy, confusion matrices, and probabilities. Discuss suitability, suggest enhancements, providing a concise analysis.

# Discussion of results and reflection
1. How accurate is each model?
    - Based on the confusion matrices and accurate scores, the model is highly accurate for the Setosa species, with a 100% accuracy. However, the model's accuracy is lower for the versicolor and virginica species, with accuracies of 63.16% and 97.37%, respectively.
      
2. Is logistic regression a good use case for classifying the iris data set? Elucidate your answer.
    -Logistic regression is a good use case for classifying the iris dataset. Logistic regression is a learning algorithm that is used to predict binary outcomes, such as whether a flower is of species A or species B. The iris dataset has three species, but it can be converted into a binary classification problem by pairing up species two by two.

3. What are your recommendations for improving the classification of this data set? Explain.
   a. Use a more complex algorithm.
     - While logistic regression is a good use cafe for this dataset, it may not be able  to accurately capture more complex relationships          between features in the dataset. With more complex algorithm the dataset may be able to achieve a higher accuracy on the dataset.
   b. Larger datas
     - The iris dataset is relatively small, with only 150 data, this can make it difficult for the machine learning algorithm to learn the         relationships between the features. A larger dataset to train the model on could lead to improved accuracy.
