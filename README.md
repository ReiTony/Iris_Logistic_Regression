# Iris_Logistic_Regression
This project explores binary logistic regression on the Iris dataset to classify Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. Evaluate model accuracy, confusion matrices, and probabilities. Discuss suitability, suggest enhancements, providing a concise analysis.

# Discussion of Results and Reflection

1. **How accurate is each model?**
   - The model achieves high accuracy for the Setosa species (100%) based on the confusion matrix and accuracy scores. However, for Versicolor and Virginica, accuracies are slightly lower at 63.16% and 97.37%, respectively.

2. **Is logistic regression a good use case for classifying the Iris dataset? Elucidate your answer.**
   - Logistic regression proves effective for Iris dataset classification. It excels in binary outcomes, suitable for pairing Iris species in a two-by-two manner. Despite slight variations in accuracy, it serves as a robust choice for this dataset.

3. **Recommendations for Improving Classification:**
   a. *Utilize a more complex algorithm.*
      - While logistic regression is suitable, a more intricate algorithm may capture complex relationships better, potentially improving accuracy.
   b. *Increase dataset size.*
      - With only 150 entries, the Iris dataset is relatively small. Expanding the dataset can enhance the machine learning model's ability to discern intricate feature relationships, likely leading to improved accuracy.
